## üìä Data Persistence Benefits

### ‚úÖ Your Data Will Be Safe Because:
- **IndexedDB Storage**: Much more reliable than localStorage
- **Offline Capability**: App works without internet
- **iOS Compatibility**: IndexedDB works great on iPhones
- **Auto-Migration**: Existing localStorage data automatically moves to IndexedDB

### üîÑ Data Sync Across Sessions:
- Your transactions will persist between app closures
- Budget data stays saved
- Works even after iOS updates
- No data loss when clearing browser cache

## üéØ Recommended Workflow:

1. **Deploy to Vercel** (takes 5 minutes)
2. **Install on iPhone** from the live URL
3. **Start using it** - your data will be safely stored in IndexedDB
4. **Any updates** you make locally can be pushed to GitHub and auto-deployed

## üìù Notes:
- The app will work 100% offline once installed
- All your expense data stays on your device (privacy-first)
- No server costs - completely free hosting
- Professional URLs that you can share
