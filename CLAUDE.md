- Never ask again to run NPM Run Dev, because I will always have that running in a separate terminal.
1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Every step of the way, please give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Keep in mind that this site might be live, with users and data. So ask. If so, think through any changes which might affect the API and existing data.
8. Create a todo.md file with the summary of changes I've made per session, that way we can remember where we last left off.
9. Keep document of all the steps you are doing them as you work on them and finish them, that way if we run out of tokens you know where you last left of.
